You can find an introduction to <i>k</i>-automata
<a href="automata.ps">here</a>. It is a revised version of a
presentation I once gave.<br>
<br>
An <a href="automata.tgz">implementation</a> of <i>k</i>-automata
including examples written in C.<br>
Non-<i>k</i>-automata can also be constructed, the Fibonacci automaton is
included as an example.<br>
The class of automata this program accepts is described in
<a href="semi.pdf">this</a> document about Numeration-automatic sequences.<br>
Note that you do not need to feed an arbitrary automaton with the correct
expansion, you could filter out all the 'garbage'.<br>
<br>
A simple implementation of substitutions in
<a href="subst.tgz">general</a> used to verify the correctness of
the constructed automata.<br>
<br>
An <a href="semi/">online</a> version of the program is also available and
<a href="websemi.tgz">here</a> is the source for those who want to run this
program on their own webserver.
