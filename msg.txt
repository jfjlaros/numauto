Hi'

I had some time to have a look at your paper. My only problem is that I do not 
really know what you are waiting for. So I will give you all my thoughts 
about it...

To summary the problem, you consider a substitution $\sigma$ which gives you 
in a natural way an automaton and therefore a regular language $L$. On the 
other hand, the substitution also defines a numeration system built over a 
sequence of integers given by the lengths of $\sigma^n(i)$. The main question 
is then when the representation of $n$ in the numeration system coincide with 
the $n$-th word of the language $L$ (supposed to be lexicographically 
ordered) ?

Do you want to submit it for publication ? If this is the case, you should not 
do it in its actual form because you recall a lot a well-known things. But 
the question you are considering is certainly of interest and I'm not sure it 
has already been investigated (see comments below especially the 
Dumont-Thomas' papers). So if you have enough results for this main question 
about the relationship between the two notions, a short note of a few pages 
could be something.

Now, I will give you my comments, suggestions, questions in chronological 
order of your paper.

1) you are interested in substitutions giving rise to numeration systems. A 
few years ago, Arnaud Maes (who has now turned to insurance company instead 
of mathematical research) has considered such a concept. Maybe you can obtain 
some of his papers (see on MathReview). I have his thesis where such systems 
are just a remark but he defines the representation of $n$ as the $n$-th word 
accepted by the automaton related to the substitution.

2) a typo remark, p.2 in def. 2.0.1 the words "output alphabet" and "output 
function" should be emphasized.

3) in your def. 2.0.4, the definition of a substitution certainly requires a 
special initial symbol and not only the mapping $\sigma$.
You can also make use of $\mathcal{A}^+$ instead of 
$\mathcal{A}^*-\{\epsilon\}$ since you have defined this operation earlier.

4) you speak of numeration systems, two papers I really like are the 
following. The first one is a nice survey on integer base systems :

Bruyère, Véronique; Hansel, Georges; Michaux, Christian; Villemaire, Roger 
Logic and $p$-recognizable sets of integers. Journées Montoises (Mons, 1992). 
Bull. Belg. Math. Soc. Simon Stevin 1 (1994), no. 2, 191--238.

(it includes discussion on "p-subsitution")

and the second one (also include a part on substitutions) is a generalization 
to "Bertrand systems":

Bruyère, Véronique; Hansel, Georges Bertrand numeration systems and 
recognizability. Latin American Theoretical INformatics (Valparaíso, 1995). 
Theoret. Comput. Sci. 181 (1997), no. 1, 17--43.

5) p.5, this is something I do not really understand... the definition of 
"full numeration system".  In your definition 2.0.9, do you assume that the 
words A and B are the greedy representations ? because, for instance, take 
the usual decimal system,  500+600=1100, 11=5+6<U_2=100 but eleven is not an 
admissible digit, so (11)00 is not a valid greedy representation.
If this is not the way we have to understand this, then every system is full 
automatic, if n=a_k U_k+... + a_0 U_0 and m=b_k U_k+... + b_0 U_0 then we 
have m+n=(a_k+b_k) U_k+... + (a_0+b_0) U_0.

The thing is certainly clear for you but maybe not the way you write it. Or 
I've read it too quickly maybe !

6) the association of an automaton to a substitution is something classical. 
You can find it in the semial paper of Cobham :

Cobham, Alan Uniform tag sequences. Math. Systems Theory 6 (1972), 164--192.

7) Lemma 3.1.1 is familiar to me. Indeed, I've used its corollary 3.2.1 in one 
of my papers:

Rigo, Michel; Maes, Arnaud More on generalized automatic sequences. J. Autom. 
Lang. Comb. 7 (2002), no. 3, 351--376. 

you can download a preprint of it on my homepage www.discmath.ulg.ac.be 
and go to the topic "research" (see page 11, Lemma 22 of the preprint).

8) p.5, I like the idea of "Computation tree".

9) p.7, you ignore words with leading zeroes. I do the same in the above cited 
paper.

10) p.8 "which have" -> "which has", "a priory" -> "a priori".

11) "The problem is that we cannot give the n-th word of a regular 
language"... This is something I've tried to do in the past few years. 
Indeed, I have such an algorithm for an arbitrary regular language (this 
algorithm uses sequences related to the number of words accepted from the 
different states of the automaton). You can have a look at the paper :

P. Lecomte, M. Rigo, Numerations systems on a regular language, Theory of 
Comput. Syst. 34 (2001), 27--44.

or also, in my PhD thesis where I give more details (once again, everything is 
on my web-page). See page 16 of my thesis.

12) p.8-11 and in particular lemma 5.0.2. Something you definitively need to 
look at are the Dumont-Thomas' papers. I'm sorry I'm not able to put my hand 
on it but I'm pretty sure they define exactly the same kind of numeration as 
you do ! at least, they give a few things on this topic in the following 
paper :

Dumont, Jean-Marie; Thomas, Alain Digital sum moments and substitutions. Acta 
Arith. 64 (1993), no. 3, 205--225.

but maybe also in : 

Dumont, J.-M.; Thomas, A. Digital sum problems and substitutions on a finite 
alphabet. J. Number Theory 39 (1991), no. 3, 351--366.

I know that there are also able to define representation of real number using 
substitutions.

13) p.11, I do not agree with your definition of greedy expansion 5.1.1. I 
think you should have a condition like :
$\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} a_i U_i <U_j$ which has to hold for all $j$.

14) p.15, I have a problem to understand the meaning of theorem 6.0.5.
Does it simply mean that the image of $\sigma_0$ has $\sigma_0$ as prefix ? 
Moreover, it is akward to say "let $\sigma_0,\ldots,\sigma_m$ be a 
substitution. Because a substitution is a mapping, here it seems that the 
$\sigma_i$'s are letters...

15) at the end of page 15, you speak of minimality. I'm sure the minimality is 
so obvious in the context we consider. Indeed, minimal automaton of a regular 
language is something well-known but here we speak of minimal automaton with 
respect to the generated sequence. For instance, with the Thue-Morse sequence 
a->ab, b->ba, the obtained automaton is not the minimal automaton of the 
language \{a,b\}^*. So for me, such a "minimal" behaviour is not so clear. 
But once again maybe I read it too quickly but I just wanted to warn you 
about this point.

16) p. 18, for reverse reading, once again you can have a lookt at the 
"Maes/Rigo" paper where we also define kernels for arbitrary regular 
languages. This definition relies once again on "abstract numeration systems" 
where any integer $n$ is represented ny the $n$-th word of an ordered regular 
language.


I hope that I was not too long. My first advice is to have a look at 
Dumont-Thomas. With this e-mail, I give you the master thesis of a student of 
Valerie Berthe (who Robert knows well). Unfortunately, this document is in 
french but it should include something on substitutive-numeration systems.

Do not hesitate to recontact me for any reason. If I have enough time, I will 
be pleased to help you.

Best regards,

Michel.
